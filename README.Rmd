`dataRC` is an R package designed to bring efficient data management technologies to everyone. It aims to enhance efficiency in data handling by providing easy-to-use tools for converting files to Apache Parquet format, unifying heterogeneous databases, providing templates for data processing and more.  Whether you have little to none programming experience or are an advanced user, `dataRC` simplifies repetitive processes and boosts your productivity.

## Installation
At present, installation of the package is only supported from GitHub. However, as the package adheres to CRAN's best practices, we anticipate its availability on CRAN in the near future.
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jdrengifoc/dataRC")
```

## Usage

```{r convert_files}
library(dataRC)

# Convert all the .dta, .txt, and .csv files in the current folder into Parquet
# format and store them in the folder ./parquet_files.
# convert_files(
#   folder = ".", files = list.files(pattern = '(dta|txt|csv)$'), 
#   new_extension = "parquet", new_folder = '/parquet_files')

# Create a partial dictionary to ease data homogenization without making
# unexpected changes to original data.
# dict_path <- 'dict.xlsx'
# create_partial_dictionary(
#   folder = '/parquet_files', files = list.files(), dict_path, verbose = F)
# Add descriptive statistics and sort the partial dictionary for final manual
# review.
# sort_partial_dictionary(dict_path, overwrite = T)
```
